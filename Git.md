# Git
Git is a distributed version-control system developed for Linus Torval in 2005.

Github is a repository website, where you can save and administrate your programming project. You can work with your friends/co-worker/stragers in a especific project. Colaborated each other, seing the changes, tracking the bugs, commits feature updates and even creating a wiki for the project.
So Github are a really powerfull tools for developers.

## Concepts of Github
---
1. **Respository**: Place online for save your code

2. **Control version**: A way to track and find the version of the releases in the code.

3. **Branchs**: Are a paralel version of the code in the repo. So there is a main branch with the first code. And each branch is created for a new version, feature or bug.

4. **Commits**: are the comments you will let every time is a change in a file. Is recommended to made one for file, so it will be better for track

5. **Pull/Push request**: Is a direct request from your local change to the online and principal repository. If you dont have permissions to change the repositories it will wait until the administrador accept it.

6. **Merge**: When you are working in one branch and you need to add this code to the main branch you have to merge first the main branch in your branch, see if there is some code conflicts manually change it, run it again and verify everything works and then you merge it to the main branch. This is for keep a good and clean practices of work


## Commands 
--- 
Understanding the most import commands for use

    git fork: Create a copy of the project in your repository.

    git clone: Create a copy of the project in your local machine

    git pull: Ask to the online repostory if there is a change or update from anoter collaboratore

    git add [file or .]: Add a specific file or all the files

    git commit -m "[commit standars]": Add comments of the changes you are making in a specific file or files.
    
    git push: Push the changes in the online repository

[There is more commands](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)
for see the status of the repo, deletes commits, branch, repos etc.
